## í¾¯ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ semantic structure  
- **CSS3** â€“ custom styles + responsive layout  
- **Bootstrap 5** â€“ UI framework for layout and components  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ full logic for task management  
- **LocalStorage** â€“ data persistence

## íº€ How It Works

1. Click **â€œAdd Taskâ€** to create a new task.
2. Task appears in the **To Do** column.
3. Drag the task to another column (e.g., **In Progress**, **Done**).
4. Tasks auto-save in the browser (LocalStorage).
5. Reloading the page preserves your task board.
